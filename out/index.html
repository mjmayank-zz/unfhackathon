The United Nations Foundation links the UN’s work with others around the world, mobilizing the energy and expertise of business and non-governmental organizations to help the UN tackle issues including climate change, global health, peace and security, women's empowerment, poverty eradication, energy access, and U.S.-UN relations.</p><p>Girls are powerful. When they’re educated, healthy, and safe, they transform their communities. When girls stand up for girls in need, they empower each other and transform our world. As the United Nations Foundation’s adolescent girl campaign, Girl Up engages girls to take action. Led by a community of nearly half a million passionate advocates raising awareness and funds, our efforts help the hardest to reach girls living in places where it is hardest to be a girl.</p></div></div></div><div id="sponsors" class="section sponsors align-corners"><div class="box title blue span-3"><h4>Sponsors</h4></div><div class="box white span-9 mobile-full"><div class="sponsors-row"><div class="span-10 mobile-10 push-1"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/"><img src="img/microsoft.png"></a></div></div><div class="sponsors-row"><div class="span-6 mobile-6"><a href="http://www.gmu.edu/"><img src="img/gmu.png"></a></div><div class="span-6 mobile-6"><a href="http://modev.com"><img src="img/modev.png"></a></div></div></div></div><div id="schedule" class="section schedule large"><div class="box title blue span-3"><h4>Schedule</h4></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-12 schedule-day"><h4>Saturday, Jan 27th</h4></div></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-3 typ-right"><h6>9:00am</h6></div><div class="box span-9">Doors Open</div></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-3 typ-right"><h6>10:00am</h6></div><div class="box span-9">Opening Keynote</div></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-3 typ-right"><h6>11:00am</h6></div><div class="box span-9">Workshops (TBA)</div></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-3 typ-right"><h6>12:00pm</h6></div><div class="box span-9">Lunch</div></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-3 typ-right"><h6>12:30pm</h6></div><div class="box span-9">Workshops (TBA)</div></div><div class="row"><div class="box span-3 typ-right"><h6>9:00pm</h6></div><div class="box span-9">End of Event</div></div></div><div id="faq" class="section align-corners faq"><div class="box title left blue span-3"><h4>FAQ</h4></div><div class="box copy slate span-9 mobile-full"><h5>Do I need previous coding experience?</h5><p><strong>Nope!</strong>The point of the event is to learn. If you want to build a real app that you and others can use in real life, then this event is for you.</p><h5>Who can participate?</h5><p>This event is for all high school students! Coding experience is not required. You aren't required to have ever built an app before; we will have workshops to help you ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone - there will be a place for you.</p><h5>What should I bring?</h5><p>Laptop and charger, extension cord, cellphone and charger, photo ID, and whatever else you need to build your project.</p><h5>How many people per team?</h5><p>You can have a maximum of <strong>four (4) students</strong> on your team.</p><h5>Can I start working before The UNF Hackathon?</h5><p><strong>No.</strong> Contestants are not allowed to work on their apps prior to the event. If you want to prepare for the event, focus on gaining experience with and knowledge of the tool you hope to use to build your application.</p><h5>Do I need a team or idea to sign up?</h5><p>Nope! We will have sessions to help people find team members and/or form teams, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the event. So you should sign up regardless!</p><h5>Do I have to be there the entire time?</h5><p>Once you arrive, unless you are checked out by a parent or guardian, you will not be allowed to leave until the end of the event for safety reasons.</p><h5>Will there be food?</h5><p>Yes. The only thing you need to worry about is building your app; let us take care of the rest. Lunch, dinner, snacks, and plenty of drinks will be provided throughout the competition at no cost to participants. We will be providing vegetarian options as well. If you have a specific food allergy or other specific need, contact us and we'll try to find a way to make it work for you. Breakfast will not be provided, so please eat before arriving!</p><h5>What should I wear?</h5><p>While there are no strict guidelines on how to dress, clothing has a profound <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112000200">effect on the wearer's psychological processes</a>. If you look good, you end up doing better work. We’ll also have photographers present throughout the event, so you might want to look sharp anyways.</p><h5>What if I have a question that's not here?<p>We'd love to help answer it for you! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@girlup.org">info@girlup.org</a> with your question, and we'll get back to you within 24 hours.</p></h5></div></div><script>var PILOT_EVENT_ID = "55a873df96e75b00168e0b6e";var PILOT_EVENT_PRICE=0;</script><script type="text/javascript" src="//static.gopilot.org/projects.js"></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-43652846-4', 'gopilot.org');ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
